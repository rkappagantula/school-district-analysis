Top Performing Schools

Bottom Performing Schools

Math Score by Grades

Reading Score by Grades

Score by School Spending

Score by Schools Size

Score by school type


#Summary
 - Average math and reading scores stay consistent across grade level when grouped by school. There is no major improvement in scores from any school.
- Math passing rates are always consistently lower across every metric, but the difference between math and reading passing rates is greater amoung lower performing schools, large schools, and higher spending per student which all seem to correlate.
- The top 5 schools are all charter schools while the bottom 5 all district schools.
- In general (one exception), per student spending is higher in bottom performing schools than top performing.
- Schools under 2000 students have much higher passing rates than those with student populations above 2000. A comparision of 95 to 75%. - The same phenomenon is seen with high and low per student spending brackets and district versus charter schools.
